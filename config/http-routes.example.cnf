Example HTTP Route Table

Each route is specified on separate lines, and only lines that start
with a valid HTTP method (get, put, post, head, connect, options,
delete, or trace), then followed by a relative [URI template] (where
the first directory or folder in the URI path is not a {variable}
declaration, since the first directory defines the Integration Server
HTTP dispatcher directive the route is registered under), then
followed by a fully-qualified service name, and then an optional
description are interpreted as routes. All other lines are ignored.

[URI template]: <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570>
