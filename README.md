# Tundra ‚ùÑ

A package of useful services for webMethods Integration Server 7.1 or higher.

## Dependencies

Tundra is dependent on the following packages:

* WmFlatFile
* WmPublic
* WmRoot

## Installation

You have two choices for installing Tundra: git or zip. If you are comfortable
using git, I recommend this method as you can then easily switch between
package versions using git checkout and download new versions using git fetch.

### Using Git

To install with this method, first make sure that:
* Git is [installed](http://git-scm.com/downloads) on your Integration Server.
* Your Integration Server has internet access to https://github.com (for
  cloning the repository).
* The dependent packages listed above are installed and enabled on your
  Integration Server.

From your Integration Server installation:

```sh
$ cd ./packages/
$ git clone https://github.com/Permafrost/Tundra.git
$ cd ./Tundra/
$ git checkout v<n.n.n> # where <n.n.n> is the desired version
```

Then activate and enable the Tundra package from the package management web
page on your Integration Server web administration site.

### Using Zip

1.  Download a zip of the desired version of the package from
    https://github.com/Permafrost/Tundra/releases.
2.  Copy the Tundra-n.n.n.zip file to your Integration Server's
    `./replicate/inbound/` directory.
3.  Install and activate the Tundra package release (Tundra-n.n.n.zip) from
    the package management web page on your Integration Server's web
    administration site.

## Upgrading

When upgrading you have to choose the same method used to originally install
the package. Unfortunately, if git wasn't used to install the package then you
can't use git to upgrade it either. However, if you want to switch to using
git to manage the package, delete the installed package and start over using
the git method for installation.

### Using Git

To upgrade with this method, first make sure that:
* Git is [installed](http://git-scm.com/downloads) on your Integration Server.
* Your Integration Server has internet access to https://github.com (for
  fetching updates from the repository).
* The dependent packages listed above are installed and enabled on your
  Integration Server.
* You originally installed Tundra using the git method described above.

From your Integration Server installation:

```sh
$ cd ./packages/Tundra/
$ git fetch
$ git checkout v<n.n.n> # where <n.n.n> is the desired updated version
```

Then reload the Tundra package from the package management web page on your
Integration Server web administration site.

### Using Zip

1.  Download a zip of the desired updated version of the package from
    https://github.com/Permafrost/Tundra/releases.
2.  Copy the Tundra-n.n.n.zip file to your Integration Server's
    `./replicate/inbound/` directory.
3.  Install and activate the updated Tundra package release (Tundra-n.n.n.zip)
    from the package management web page on your Integration Server's web
    administration site.

## Conventions

1.  All input and output pipeline arguments are prefixed with '$' as a poor-
    man's scoping mechanism (typical user-space variables will be unprefixed).
2.  All boolean arguments are suffixed with a '?'.
3.  Single-word argument names are preferred. Where multiple words are
    necessary, words are separated with a '.'.
4.  Service namespace is kept flat. Namespace folders are usually nouns.
    Service names are usually verbs, indicating the action performed on the
    noun (parent folder).
5.  All private elements are kept in the tundra.support folder. All other
    elements comprise the public API of the package. As the private elements
    do not contribute to the public API, they are liable to change at any
    time. Enter at your own risk.
6.  *Almost* all services are written in Java, and are *almost* always
    overloaded by a backing method in the shared source, which provides the
    actual implementation. This way, backing methods can be used by other
    backing methods directly, without needing to deal with the
    IData/IDataCursor/IDataUtil nastiness that a fronting Java service is
    usually required to deal with.

## Tests

*Almost* every service in Tundra has unit tests, located in the [TundraTest]
package. To run the test suite first install the [TundraTest] package, and
then either:

* Run the `Tundra/tundra:test($package = "TundraTest")` service directly, or
* Visit <http://localhost:5555/invoke/tundra/test?$package=TundraTest>
  (substitute your own Integration Server host and port for localhost:5555).

  destination URI.

  Additional delivery protocols can be implemented by creating a service named
  for the URI scheme in the folder `Tundra/tundra.support.content.deliver`.

      the Java virtual machine [default charset].
    * `$destination` is a URI identifying the location where the given
      `$content` should be delivered. Supports the following delivery
      protocols / URI schemes:
      * `file`: writes the given content to the file specified by the
        destination URI. The following additional options can be provided via
        the `$pipeline` document:
        * `$mode`: append / write
      * `http`: transmits the given content to the destination URI. The
        following additional options can be provided via the `$pipeline`
        document:
        * `$method`: get / put / post / delete / head / trace / options
        * `$headers/*`: additional HTTP headers as required
        * `$authority/user`: the username to log on to the remote web server
        * `$authority/password`: the password to log on to the remote web
          server
      * `https`: refer to `http`
      * `mailto`: sends an email with the given content attached. An example
        mailto URI is as follows:
        `mailto:bob@example.com?cc=jane@example.com&subject=Example&body=Example&attachment=message.xml`.

        The following additional override options can be provided via the
        `$pipeline` document:
        * `$attachment`: the attached file's name
        * `$from`: email address to send the email from
        * `$subject`: the subject line text

           configured in the Integration Server setting
           `watt.server.smtpServer`.
    * `$pipeline` is an optional IData document for providing arbitrary
      variables to the delivery implementation service.

      be returned by specific delivery protocols.
    * `$response` is an optional response content returned by the delivery
      (for example, the HTTP response body).
    * `$response.type` is an optional MIME media type describing the type of
      `$response` returned.

* #### tundra.content:discard

  Receives arbitrary (XML or flat file) content and then discards it (does

* #### tundra.content:emit

  Converts an IData document to an XML or flat file string, byte array, or
  input stream.

  * Inputs:
    * `$document` is the IData document to be serialized as a string, byte
      array, or input stream.
    * `$encoding` is an optional character set to use when encoding the
      resulting text data to a byte array or input stream. Defaults to the
      Java virtual machine [default charset].
    * `$schema` is the fully-qualified name of the document reference (for
      XML) or flat file schema (for flat files) used to serialize `$document`.
    * `$mode` is an optional choice of {stream, bytes, string} which specifies
      the type of object `$content` is returned as. Defaults to stream.
  * Outputs:
    * `$content` is the resulting serialization of `$document` as XML or flat
      file content.

* #### tundra.content:parse

  Parses XML and flat file content (specified as a string, byte array, or
  input stream) into an IData document.

  * Inputs:
    * `$content` is a string, byte array, or input stream containing XML or
      flat file content to be parsed.
    * `$encoding` is an optional character set to use when `$content` is
      provided as a byte array or input stream to decode the contained text
      data. Defaults to the Java virtual machine [default charset].
    * `$schema` is the fully-qualified name of the document reference (for
      XML) or flat file schema (for flat files) used to parse `$content`.
  * Outputs:
    * `$document` is the resulting IData document representing the parsed
      `$content`.

* #### tundra.content:reject

  Receives arbitrary (XML or flat file) content and then rejects it by always
  returning an error to the client.

  This service is intended to be invoked by clients via HTTP or FTP.

* #### tundra.content:retrieve

  Retrieves arbitrary content (XML, flat files, binary) from the given
  `$source` URI, and calls the given content processing service to process it.

  Additional retrieval protocols can be implemented by creating a service
  named for the URI scheme in the folder `Tundra/tundra.support.content.retrieve`.
  Services in this folder must implement the `Tundra/tundra.schema.content.retrieve:handler` specification.

  * Inputs:
    * `$source` is a URI identifying the location from which content is to be
      retrieved. Supports the following retrieval protocols / URI schemes:
      * `file`: processes each file matching the given $source URI with the
        given processing $service.

        The file component of the URI can include wildcards or globs (such as *.txt or *.j?r) for matching multiple files at once. For example,
        `file:////server:port/directory/*.txt` would process all *.txt files
        in the specified directory.

        To ensure each file processed is not locked or being written to by
        another process, the file is first moved to a `./archive` directory
        prior to processing.
    * `$service` is the fully-qualified name of the content processing
      service, which implements the `Tundra/tundra.schema.content.retrieve:processor`
      specification, invoked to process each item of content retrieved from
      the `$source` URI.
    * `$limit` is an optional maximum number of content matches to be
      processed in a single execution. Defaults to 1000.

* #### tundra.content:split

  the given splitting service, passing the parsed `$content` as an input, and
  emitting the split list of `$contents` as output.

  * Inputs:
    * `$content` is a string, byte array, or input stream of XML or flat file
      content to be split.
    * `$service` is the fully-qualified name of the splitting service, which
      accepts a single IData document and returns an IData document list,
      called to split the parsed `$content`.
    * `$pipeline` is an optional IData document containing arbitrary variables
      to be included in the input pipeline of the invocation of `$service`.
    * `$encoding.input` is an optional character set used to decode the text
      data if `$content` is provided as a byte array or input stream. Defaults
      to the Java virtual machine [default charset].

      text datum if the specified `$mode.output` is a byte array or stream.
      Defaults to the Java virtual machine [default charset].
    * `$schema.input` is the fully-qualified name of the document reference
      (for XML) or flat file schema (for flat files) used to parse `$content`.
    * `$schema.output` is an optional fully-qualified name of the document
      reference (for XML) or flat file schema (for flat files) used to emit or
      serialize the resulting list of IData documents returned by `$service`
      when all documents in the list are alike.

      Alternatively, it is perfectly permissible for the resulting list
      returned by `$service` to contain unlike documents (documents whose
      formats are different), and in this case `$service` is required to
      return a string list `$schemas`, where each item in `$schemas` is the
      fully-qualified document reference (for XML) or flat file schema (for
      flat files) corresponding to the same indexed item in the returned
      document list to be used to emit/serialize that item.
    * `$service.input` is an optional variable name to use in the input
      pipeline of the call to `$service` for the parsed `$content` IData
      document. Defaults to `$document`.
    * `$service.output` is an optional variable name used to extract the
      output IData document list from the output pipeline of the call to
      `$service`. Defaults to `$documents`.
    * `$mode.output` is an optional choice of {stream, bytes, string} which
      specifies the type of object each item in `$contents` is returned as.

    * `$schemas` is the list of fully-qualified document reference (for XML)
      or flat file schema (for flat files) names, if the `$contents` list
      contains unlike content formats.

* #### tundra.content:translate

      flat file content to be translated to another format.
    * `$service` is the fully-qualified name of the translation service, which
      accepts a single IData document and returns a single IData document,
      called to translate the parsed `$content`.
    * `$encoding.input` is an optional character set used to decode the text
      data if `$content` is provided as a byte array or input stream. Defaults
      to the Java virtual machine [default charset].
    * `$encoding.output` is an optional character set used to encode the
      translated text data if the specified `$mode.output` is a byte array or
      stream. Defaults to the Java virtual machine [default charset].
    * `$schema.input` is the fully-qualified name of the document reference
      (for XML) or flat file schema (for flat files) used to parse `$content`.
    * `$schema.output` is the fully-qualified name of the document reference
      (for XML) or flat file schema (for flat files) used to emit or serialize
      the resulting IData document returned by `$service`.

        either a relative or absolute file path or file: [URI]. If the 
        target file already exists, it will be overwritten or appended to,
        depending on the `$mode` selected, with the source file content.
      * `$mode` is an optional choice of 'write' or 'append', which determines
        whether the target file will be overwritten or appended to respectively.
        Defaults to 'append', since this is the safer option.

* #### tundra.file:create

    Atomically creates a new empty file if a file with this name does not 
    yet exist. 

    The check for the existence of the file and the creation of the file 
    if it does not exist are a single operation that is atomic with respect 
    to all other file system activities that might affect the file.

    * Inputs:
      * `$file` is the name of the file to be created, specified as either a
        relative or absolute file path or file: [URI]. If the file already

        file path or file: [URI].

    * Outputs:
      * `$executable?` is a boolean flag indicating if Integration Server
        has permission to execute the given file. If the file does not
        exist, false is returned.

    * Inputs:
      * `$file` is the name of the file to test existence of, specified as 
        either a relative or absolute file path or file: [URI].

    * Outputs:
      * `$exists?` is a boolean flag indicating if the given file exists.

* #### tundra.file:length

    Returns the length of the given file in bytes.

    * Inputs:
      * `$file` is the name of the file whose length is to be 
        checked, specified as either a relative or absolute 
        file path or file: [URI].

    * Outputs:
      * `$length` is the length or size in bytes of the given 
        file. If the file does not exist, zero is returned.

* #### tundra.file:match

        absolute file path or file: [URI].
      * `$pattern` is either a regular expression or wildcard
        pattern, depending on the `$mode` selected, to check 
        the file name against
      * `$mode` is an optional choice of either 'regex' or 
        'wildcard' which determines the type of pattern
        specified. Defaults to 'regex'.

    * Outputs:
      * `$match?` is a boolean flag indicating if the file name
        matches the given `$pattern`. Only the file name is 
        considered in the match, not the path.

    Returns the canonical file: URI that represents the given 
    file.

    * Inputs:
      * `$file` is the file name to be normalized to the canonical
        file: [URI], specified as either a relative or absolute 
        file path or file: [URI].

    * Outputs:
      * `$file` is the canonical file: [URI] that represents the
        given file.

* #### tundra.file:process

    Provides a safe way of processing a file as a stream, which
    is useful for large files or memory constrained environments, 
    by opening a file for reading, writing, or appending, calling
    the given service with the opened file stream object as an 
    input, and finally closing the stream when done.

    As such, the invoked service does not need to open or close the file
    stream itself, it only needs to process the opened file stream.
    The stream is guaranteed to be closed automatically, regardless
    of whether an exception is encountered by the service.

    * Inputs:
      * `$file` is the name of the file to be processed, specified 
        as either a relative or absolute file path or file: [URI].

        reading, writing, or appending. Defaults to 'read'.
      * `$service` is the fully-qualified name of the service which
        will be called to process the opened file.
      * `$pipeline` is an optional IData document for specifying
        arbitrary input parameters to the call to `$service`. If 
        provided, the call to `$service` is scoped with this IData,
        and will not have access to the global pipeline.
      * `$service.input` is an optional input parameter name used
        when adding the opened file stream to the input pipeline
        of the call tor `$service`. Defaults to '$stream'.

    * Outputs:
      * `$pipeline` is an optional IData document representing the 
        output pipeline of the call to `$service`. This will only
        be returned if an input `$pipeline` was provided. If no
        input `$pipeline` was provided, any outputs from the call
        to `$service` will be merged directly into the global 
        pipeline.

* #### tundra.file:read

    Reads a file in full, returning the content as either an input 
    stream, byte array, or string. 

    As this service reads the entire file into memory, consider 
    using tundra.file:process instead for large files or in memory 
    constrained environments.

    * Inputs:
      * `$file` is the name of the file to be read, specified as 
        either a relative or absolute file path or file: [URI].
      * `$mode` is an optional choice of 'stream', 'bytes', or
        'string' which determines how the file contents are
        returned. Defaults to 'stream'.
      * `$encoding` is an optional character set to use when reading
        the file as a string. Defaults to the Java virtual machine 
        [default charset].

    * Outputs:
      * `$content` is the file contents returned as either an input
        stream, byte array, or string depending on the `$mode` 
        selected. Note that even when returned as an input stream,
        the entire file has been read into memory. This mode is 
        provided as a convenience only, and since the file contents
        are returned as a [java.io.ByteArrayInputStream] object the 
        stream does not need to be explicitly closed as no system
        resources (file handles) are held.

* #### tundra.file:readable

    Returns true if Integration Server can read the given file.

    * Inputs:
      * `$file` is the name of the file to test if Integration Server has
        read permissions, specified as either a relative or absolute 
        file path or file: [URI].

    * Outputs:
      * `$readable?` is a boolean flag indicating if Integration Server
        has permission to read the given file. If the file does not
        exist, false is returned.

* #### tundra.file:remove

    Deletes the given file, if it exists. This service does nothing if the
    file does not exist (no exception is thrown).

    * Inputs:
      * `$file` is the name of the file to be deleted, specified as either a
        relative or absolute file path or file: [URI]. If the file does not
        exists, this service does nothing.

* #### tundra.file:rename

    Renames the source file to the target file name.

    * Inputs:
      * `$file.source` is the name of the file to be renamed, specified as either a
        relative or absolute file path or file: [URI]. If the source file does not
        exist, an exception will be thrown.
      * `$file.target` is the new name for the renamed file, specified as either a
        relative or absolute file path or file: [URI]. If the target file already
        exists, an exception will be thrown.

* #### tundra.file:touch

    Updates the modification time of the given file to now, or creates a 
    new file if it doesn't already exist.

    * Inputs:
      * `$file` is the name of the file to be touched, specified as either a
        relative or absolute file path or file: [URI]. If the file does not
        exist, it will be created. If the file does exist, its modification
        time will be updated to current time.

* #### tundra.file:type

    Determines the [mime type] for the given file. 

    Integration Server file extension to [mime type] mappings are defined 
    in the file ./lib/mime.types. If the [mime type] cannot be found, it 
    defaults to the [mime type] for arbitrary binary data: 

        application/octet-stream

    * Inputs:
      * `$file` is the name of the file whose mime type is to be determined, 
        specified as either a relative or absolute file path or file: [URI]. 
        The file is not required to exist, since the mime type is determined
        purely from the file name itself.

    * Outputs:
      * `$type` is the [mime type] of the given file.

* #### tundra.file:writable

    Returns true if Integration Server can write to the given file.

    * Inputs:
      * `$file` is the name of the file to test if Integration Server has
        write permissions, specified as either a relative or absolute 
        file path or file: [URI].

    * Outputs:
      * `$writable?` is a boolean flag indicating if Integration Server
        has permission to write or append to the given file. If the 
        file does not exist, false is returned.

* #### tundra.file:write

    Writes or appends the content, provided as a string, byte array or input 
    stream, to the given file.

    If no file is specified, a new temporary file is created automatically.

    * Inputs:
      * `$file` is the optional name of the file to which the given content
        is to be written or appended, specified as either a relative or 
        absolute file path or file: [URI]. If not specified, a new temporary
        file will be created automatically.
      * `$mode` is an optional choice of 'write' or 'append', which determines
        whether the file will be overwritten or appended to respectively.
        Defaults to 'append', since this is the safer option.
      * `$content` is a string, byte array, or input stream containing data
        to be written or appended to the given file.
      * `$encoding` is an optional character set to use when $content has
        been provided as a string. Defaults to the Java virtual machine 
        [default charset].

    * Outputs:
      * `$file` is the name of the file that was written or appended to. If
        no input file name was specified, this is the name of the temporary
        file that was created automatically.

### HTTP

* #### tundra.http:client

    Provides an [HTTP] client for issuing requests against [HTTP] servers.

    * Inputs:
      * `$request` is an IData document containing the parameters required for
        making an [HTTP] request to an [HTTP] server.
      * `$service` is an optional custom [HTTP] response handler service, which
        implements the `tundra.schema.http.response:handler` specification, and 
        can be specified when the standard `tundra.http.response:handle` service 
        does not suffice. The standard handler does the following:
        * checks the [HTTP response code] is < 400, and throws an exception 
          when it is not
        * normalizes the response header keys to lower case
        * converts the response body stream to bytes

    * Outputs:
      * `$response` is an IData document containing the [HTTP] server response for
        the given request.

* #### tundra.http.response:handle

    Standard [HTTP] response handler: checks that the [HTTP response code] is < 400, 
    normalizes the response header keys to lower case, and converts the response body 
    stream to bytes. If the [HTTP response code] is >= 400, an exception will be
    thrown.

    * Inputs:
      * `$response` is the [HTTP] response to be processed by this service.

    * Outputs:
      * `$response` is the processed [HTTP] response, where the [HTTP response code] is 
        guaranteed to be < 400, the response header keys are normalized to lower case, 
        and the response body is returned as a byte[] array.

### ID

* #### tundra.id:generate

    Generates an immutable universally unique identifier ([UUID]). A [UUID] 
    represents a 128-bit value.

    There exist different variants of these global identifiers. The methods 
    of this class are for manipulating the Leach-Salz variant, although the
    constructors allow the creation of any variant of [UUID] (described below).

    The layout of a variant 2 (Leach-Salz) [UUID] is as follows: The most 
    significant long consists of the following unsigned fields:

        0xFFFFFFFF00000000 time_low
        0x00000000FFFF0000 time_mid
        0x000000000000F000 version
        0x0000000000000FFF time_hi

    The least significant long consists of the following unsigned fields:

        0xC000000000000000 variant
        0x3FFF000000000000 clock_seq
        0x0000FFFFFFFFFFFF node

    The variant field contains a value which identifies the layout of the 
    [UUID]. The bit layout described above is valid only for a [UUID] with a 
    variant value of 2, which indicates the Leach-Salz variant.

    The version field holds a value that describes the type of this [UUID]. 
    There are four different basic types of UUIDs: time-based, DCE 
    security, name-based, and randomly generated UUIDs. These types 
    have a version value of 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively.

    For more information including algorithms used to create UUIDs, 
    see the Internet-Draft UUIDs and GUIDs or the standards body 
    definition at ISO/IEC 11578:1996. 

    * Outputs:
      * `$id` is the generated [UUID].

        `$service`, `$catch`, and `$finally`. This is only returned if
        `$pipeline` was specified as an input. Otherwise, the outputs
        of these invocations are merged directly with the pipeline
        itself.

* #### tundra.service:invoke

    Invokes a service either synchronously or asynchronously, and 
    either scoped or unscoped.

    * Inputs
      * `$service` is the fully-qualified name of the service to be
        invoked.
      * `$pipeline` is an optional IData document which, if specified,
        contains the input arguments for the invocation of `$service`; 
        in other words, the invocation is scoped to this IData document. 
        If not specified, the invocation is unscoped, and hence the
        service will operate directly against the pipeline itself.
      * `$mode` is an optional choice of execution mode: either synchronous
        or asynchronous. When synchronous, the invocation of 
        `Tundra/tundra.service:invoke` blocks until the invocation of 
        `$service` completes. When asynchronous, `Tundra/tundra.service:invoke` 
        returns immediately and the invocation of `$service` occurs on another 
        thread.

    * Outputs:
      * `$pipeline` is the output pipeline of the invocation of
        `$service`. This is only returned if the `$mode` is synchronous,
        and the invocation was scoped (`$pipeline` was specified as an 
        input). If the invocation was synchronous and unscoped, the 
        outputs of the invocation are merged directly with the pipeline 
        itself. If the invocation was asynchronous, then no outputs
        are returned.
      * `$thread` is returned only when the invocation `$mode` is asynchronous, 
        and is the thread object which can later be waited on to finish 
        using `Tundra/tundra.service:join`.

* #### tundra.service:join

    Waits for the given service thread to finish before returning the 
    service output pipeline.

    * Inputs
      * `$thread` is a service thread object returned by 
        `Tundra/tundra.service:invoke` when a service is invoked
        asynchronously.

      * `$pipeline` is the output pipeline returned by the service 
        thread.

* #### tundra.service:nothing

    This service deliberately does nothing.

* #### tundra.service:self

    Returns the name of the current service, or null if invoked 
    directly.

    * Outputs:
      * `$self` is the fully-qualified name of the current service 
        (the service which called this service), or null if invoked 
        directly.

* #### tundra.service:sleep

    Sends the currently executing thread to sleep (temporarily 
    cease execution) for the specified duration, subject to the 
    precision and accuracy of system timers and schedulers.

    * Inputs:
      * `$duration` is an [ISO8601]/XML duration for which the
        current thread should sleep.

    a service.

    * Inputs:
      * `$service` is the name to be validated.
      * `$raise?` is a boolean flag indicating if an exception should
        be thrown if the given service is not valid. Defaults to
        false.

        to be stored in session state. If not specified, this
        service does nothing.
      * `$value` is the optional value to be stored in session state.

* #### tundra.session:remove

    Removes the given key value pair from current session state.

    * Inputs:
      * `$key` is the optional key name to use to identify the key 
        value pair to be removed from session state. If not specified, 
        this service does nothing, otherwise the key value pair is
        removed from session state.

        is specified as a [java.lang.String]. Defaults to the Java virtual machine 
        [default charset].

    * Outputs:
      * `$stream` is an optional [java.io.InputStream] object from which can be read the 
        data represented by `$object`. If `$object` was not specified, no `$stream` is

    unless the original value is already list in which case it remains 
    unmodified.

    * Inputs:
      * `$key` is a simple or fully-qualified (such as a/b/c[0]/d) key 
        identifying the string value to be converted to a list.
      * `$scope` is an optional IData document that, if specified, is used
        to resolve the given $key against. If not specified, `$key` is
        resolved against the pipeline.

    * Outputs:
      * `$scope` is returned if an input `$scope` was provided, where the value
        identified by $key within it has been converted to a list. If
        no input `$scope` was specified, the value identified by `$key` in the

### URI

Services for parsing and emitting Uniform Resource Identifier ([URI]) strings.

* #### tundra.uri:decode

    Decodes a URI-encoded (application/x-www-form-urlencoded) string, according
    to [RFC 2396].

    The following rules are applied in the conversion:
    - The alphanumeric characters "a" through "z", "A" through "Z" and "0" 
      through "9" remain the same.
    - The special characters ".", "-", "*", and "_" remain the same.
    - The plus sign "+" is converted into a space character " " .
    - A sequence of the form "%xy" will be treated as representing a byte 
      where xy is the two-digit hexadecimal representation of the 8 bits. Then, 
      all substrings that contain one or more of these byte sequences 
      consecutively will be replaced by the character(s) whose encoding would 
      result in those consecutive bytes. The encoding scheme used to decode 
      these characters may be specified, or if unspecified, the default 
      encoding of the platform will be used.

    Implemented with the [java.net.URLDecoder] class.

    * Inputs:
      * `$string` is a string containing URI-encoded data to be decoded.
      * `$encoding` is the character set used to determine what characters are 
        represented by any consecutive sequences of the form "%xy". Defaults 
        to the Java virtual machine [default charset].

    * Outputs:
      * `$string` is the decoded input string.

* #### tundra.uri:emit

    Emits a Uniform Resource Identifier ([URI]) string, according to [RFC 2396], 
    given its constituent parts.

    URIs can be categorized as either hierarchical, where the scheme and body 
    parts are separated by the character sequence '://', or opaque, where the 
    scheme and body parts are separated by a ':' character.

    Examples of hierarchical URIs:
    - http://example.com/
    - ftp://example.com/path/file.txt

    Examples of opaque URIs:
    - mailto:john.doe@example.com
    - news:comp.lang.java
    - urn:isbn:096139210x

    Opaque URIs are constructed according to the following syntax:

        (scheme:)body(?query)(#fragment)

    Where brackets (...) delineate optional components and the characters 
    ':', '?', and '#' stand for themselves.

    Hierarchical URIs are constructed according to the following syntax:

        (scheme:)(//authority)(path)(?query)(#fragment)

    Where the characters ':', '/', '?', and '#' stand for themselves. The authority
    component, if specified, can be either server-based or registry-based. If 
    server-based, it is constructed according to the syntax:

        (user:password@)host(:port)

    Implemented with the [java.net.URI] class.

    * Inputs:
      * `$uri` is an IData document containing the constituent parts to construct
        a new URI string with.

    * Outputs:
      * `$string` is the resulting URI input string.

* #### tundra.uri:encode

    URI encodes (application/x-www-form-urlencoded) a string, according
    to [RFC 2396].

    The following rules are applied in the conversion:
    - The alphanumeric characters "a" through "z", "A" through "Z" and "0" 
      through "9" remain the same.
    - The special characters ".", "-", "*", and "_" remain the same.
    - The plus sign "+" is converted into a space character " " .
    - A sequence of the form "%xy" will be treated as representing a byte 
      where xy is the two-digit hexadecimal representation of the 8 bits. Then, 
      all substrings that contain one or more of these byte sequences 
      consecutively will be replaced by the character(s) whose encoding would 
      result in those consecutive bytes. The encoding scheme used to decode 
      these characters may be specified, or if unspecified, the default 
      encoding of the platform will be used.

    Implemented with the [java.net.URLEncoder] class.

    * Inputs:
      * `$string` is a string containing data to be URI-encoded.
      * `$encoding` is the character set used to obtain the bytes for unsafe 
        characters.. Defaults to the Java virtual machine [default charset].

    * Outputs:
      * `$string` is the URI-encoded input string.

* #### tundra.uri:parse

    Parses a Uniform Resource Identifier ([URI]) string, according to [RFC 2396], 
    to its constituent parts.  

    URIs can be categorized as either hierarchical, where the scheme and body 
    parts are separated by the character sequence '://', or opaque, where the 
    scheme and body parts are separated by a ':' character.

    Examples of hierarchical URIs:
    - http://example.com/
    - ftp://example.com/path/file.txt

    Examples of opaque URIs:
    - mailto:john.doe@example.com
    - news:comp.lang.java
    - urn:isbn:096139210x

    Opaque URIs are constructed according to the following syntax:

        (scheme:)body(?query)(#fragment)

    Where brackets (...) delineate optional components and the characters 
    ':', '?', and '#' stand for themselves.

    Hierarchical URIs are constructed according to the following syntax:

        (scheme:)(//authority)(path)(?query)(#fragment)

    Where the characters ':', '/', '?', and '#' stand for themselves. The authority
    component, if specified, can be either server-based or registry-based. If 
    server-based, it is constructed according to the syntax:

        (user:password@)host(:port)

    Where the characters '@' and ':' stand for themselves.

    Opaque URI bodies are not subject to further parsing, however, to accomodate 
    the mailto: URI's use of a query string for additional data (such as cc, bcc, 
    subject, and body), this service checks if the body contains a query string 
    and, if so, parses the query string also.

    Implemented with the [java.net.URI] class.

    * Inputs:
      * `$string` is the a URI string to be parsed.

    * Outputs:
      * `$uri` is an IData document containing the constituent parts of the parsed
        URI string.

### XML

* #### tundra.xml:validate

    Validates the given content as [XML], and optionally against an [XML] 
    schema ([XSD]). Uses the Simple API for XML ([SAX]) algorithm for 
    parsing which, as it is event-based, is not memory-constrained and
    can handle arbitrarily large documents when parsing from an input stream.

    * Inputs:
      * `$content` is a string, byte array, or input stream containing 
        (potentially) [XML] data.
      * `$content.encoding` is the character set used by `$content` if provided as

        [default charset].
      * `$schema` is a string, byte array, or input stream containing [XSD] data.
      * `$schema.encoding` is the character set used by `$schema` if provided as 
        a byte array or input stream. Defaults to the Java virtual machine 
        [default charset].
      * `$raise?` is an optional boolean flag, if true and `$content` is malformed
        or invalid an exception will be thrown. If false, no exception will
        be thrown. Defaults to false.

    * Outputs:
      * `$valid?` is true if the given `$content` is well-formed [XML] and, if a
        `$schema` was specified, valid when compared to the given `$schema`.
      * `$errors` is an optional list of the errors detected by the parser in
        the given `$content`, provided when `$valid?` is false.
