# Tundra ‚ùÑ

A package of useful services for webMethods Integration Server 7.1 and higher.

## Related

See also [TundraTN](https://github.com/Permafrost/TundraTN), a package of useful services for webMethods Trading Networks 7.1 and higher.

## Dependencies

Tundra is dependent on the following packages:

* WmFlatFile
* WmPublic
* WmRoot

## Installation

You have two choices for installing Tundra: git or zip. If you are comfortable
using git, I recommend this method as you can then easily switch between
package versions using git checkout and download new versions using git fetch.

### Using Git

To install with this method, first make sure that:
* Git is [installed](http://git-scm.com/downloads) on your Integration Server.
* Your Integration Server has internet access to https://github.com (for
  cloning the repository).
* The dependent packages listed above are installed and enabled on your
  Integration Server.

From your Integration Server installation:

```sh
$ cd ./packages/
$ git clone https://github.com/Permafrost/Tundra.git
$ cd ./Tundra/
$ git checkout v<n.n.n> # where <n.n.n> is the desired version
```

Then activate and enable the Tundra package from the package management web
page on your Integration Server web administration site.

### Using Zip

1.  Download a zip of the desired version of the package from
    https://github.com/Permafrost/Tundra/releases.
2.  Copy the Tundra-vn.n.n.zip file to your Integration Server's
    `./replicate/inbound/` directory.
3.  Install and activate the Tundra package release (Tundra-vn.n.n.zip) from
    the package management web page on your Integration Server's web
    administration site.

## Upgrading

When upgrading you have to choose the same method used to originally install
the package. Unfortunately, if git wasn't used to install the package then you
can't use git to upgrade it either. However, if you want to switch to using
git to manage the package, delete the installed package and start over using
the git method for installation.

### Using Git

To upgrade with this method, first make sure that:
* Git is [installed](http://git-scm.com/downloads) on your Integration Server.
* Your Integration Server has internet access to https://github.com (for
  fetching updates from the repository).
* The dependent packages listed above are installed and enabled on your
  Integration Server.
* You originally installed Tundra using the git method described above.

From your Integration Server installation:

```sh
$ cd ./packages/Tundra/
$ git fetch
$ git checkout v<n.n.n> # where <n.n.n> is the desired updated version
```

Then reload the Tundra package from the package management web page on your
Integration Server web administration site.

### Using Zip

1.  Download a zip of the desired updated version of the package from
    https://github.com/Permafrost/Tundra/releases.
2.  Copy the Tundra-vn.n.n.zip file to your Integration Server's
    `./replicate/inbound/` directory.
3.  Install and activate the updated Tundra package release (Tundra-vn.n.n.zip)
    from the package management web page on your Integration Server's web
    administration site.

## Conventions

1.  All input and output pipeline arguments are prefixed with '$' as a poor-
    man's scoping mechanism (typical user-space variables will be unprefixed).
2.  All boolean arguments are suffixed with a '?'.
3.  Single-word argument names are preferred. Where multiple words are
    necessary, words are separated with a '.'.
4.  Service namespace is kept flat. Namespace folders are usually nouns.
    Service names are usually verbs, indicating the action performed on the
    noun (parent folder).
5.  All private elements are kept in the tundra.support folder. All other
    elements comprise the public API of the package. As the private elements
    do not contribute to the public API, they are liable to change at any
    time. Enter at your own risk.
6.  *Almost* all services are written in Java, and are *almost* always
    overloaded by a backing method in the shared source, which provides the
    actual implementation. This way, backing methods can be used by other
    backing methods directly, without needing to deal with the
    IData/IDataCursor/IDataUtil nastiness that a fronting Java service is
    usually required to deal with.

## Tests

*Almost* every service in Tundra has unit tests, located in the [TundraTest]
package. To run the test suite first install the [TundraTest] package, and
then either:

* Run the `Tundra/tundra:test($package = "TundraTest")` service directly, or
* Visit <http://localhost:5555/invoke/tundra/test?$package=TundraTest>
  (substitute your own Integration Server host and port for localhost:5555).

  results, where a test case passes if no exceptions are thrown.

  Refer to the [TundraTest] package for test case service examples.

  This service is designed to either be invoked directly, or via a web
  browser. When invoked via a browser, a basic HTML test report is displayed:

        statement, which is evaluated against the pipeline and only if the
        condition evaluates to true will the associated amended value be
        applied. If not specified, the amended value will always be applied.

    * `$schema` is an optional input which determines whether to deserialize and
      serialize the content as [XML], [JSON], Flat File, and can have the
      following values:
      * For [XML] content, specify the fully-qualified name of the document
        reference that defines the [XML] format
      * For [JSON] content specify the MIME media type "application/json"
      * For Flat File content specify the fully-qualified name of the flat
        file schema that defines the Flat File format

* #### tundra.content:deliver

  Delivers arbitrary content (string, bytes, or input stream) to the given
  destination URI.

  Additional delivery protocols can be implemented by creating a service named
  for the URI scheme in the folder `Tundra/tundra.content.deliver`.
  Services in this folder should implement the
  `Tundra/tundra.schema.content.deliver:handler` specification.

  * Inputs:
    * `$content` is a string, byte array, or input stream containing data to
      be delivered to the `$destination` URI.

      the Java virtual machine [default charset].

    * `$destination` is a URI identifying the location where the given
      `$content` should be delivered. Supports the following delivery
      protocols / URI schemes:

      * `file`: writes the given content to the file specified by the
        destination URI. The following additional options can be provided via

* #### tundra.content:reject

  Receives arbitrary (XML or flat file) content and then rejects it by always
  returning an error to the client.

  This service is intended to be invoked by clients via HTTP or FTP.

* #### tundra.content:retrieve

  Retrieves arbitrary content (XML, flat files, binary) from the given
  `$source` URI, and calls the given content processing service to process it.

  Additional retrieval protocols can be implemented by creating a service
  named for the URI scheme in the folder `Tundra/tundra.content.retrieve`.
  Services in this folder must implement the `Tundra/tundra.schema.content.retrieve:handler` specification.

  * Inputs:
    * `$source` is a URI identifying the location from which content is to be
      retrieved. Supports the following retrieval protocols / URI schemes:
      * `file`: processes each file matching the given `$source` URI with the given
        processing `$service`. The file component of the URI can include wildcards
        or globs (such as `*.txt` or `*.j?r`) for matching multiple files at once.
        For example, `file:////server:port/directory/*.txt` would process all `*.txt`
        files in the specified directory. To ensure each file processed is not
        locked or being written to by another process, the file is first moved to
        an archive directory prior to processing. The name of this directory can
        be configured by adding a query string parameter called archive to the URI,
        for example `file:////server:port/directory/*.txt?archive=backup`. In this
        example, files are first moved to a subdirectory named backup. If not
        specified, the archive directory defaults to a subdirectory named archive.
    * `$service` is the fully-qualified name of the content processing
      service, which implements the `Tundra/tundra.schema.content.retrieve:processor`
      specification, invoked to process each item of content retrieved from
      the `$source` URI.
    * `$limit` is an optional maximum number of content matches to be
      processed in a single execution. Defaults to 1000.

* #### tundra.content.retrieve:file

  The file protocol handler for the `Tundra/tundra.content:retrieve`
  service, which retrieves file content for files matching the given
  `$source` URI and calls the given `$service` content processing service
  to process each file.

  Implements the `Tundra/tundra.schema.content.retrieve:handler`
  specification.

* #### tundra.content:split

  One-to-many conversion of [XML], [JSON], or Flat File content to another 
  format. Calls the given splitting service, passing the parsed `$content` as an 
  input, and emitting the split list of $contents as output.

  * Inputs:
    * `$content` is a string, byte array, or input stream of [XML], [JSON], or
      Flat File content to be split.

    * `$service` is the fully-qualified name of the splitting service, which 
      accepts a single IData document and returns an IData document list, 
      called to split the parsed `$content`.

    * `$pipeline` is an optional IData document containing arbitrary variables 
      to be included in the input pipeline of the invocation of `$service`.

    * `$encoding.input` is an optional character set used to decode the text 
      data if `$content` is provided as a byte array or input stream. Defaults 
      to the Java virtual machine [default charset].

    * `$encoding.output` is an optional character set used to encode the split
      text datum if the specified `$mode.output` is a byte array or stream. 
      Defaults to the Java virtual machine [default charset].

    * `$schema.input` is an optional input which determines whether to parse the 
      content as [XML], [JSON], Flat File, and can have the following values:
      * For [XML] content, specify the fully-qualified name of the document 
        reference that defines the [XML] format
      * For [JSON] content specify the MIME media type "application/json"
      * For Flat File content specify the fully-qualified name of the flat 
        file schema that defines the Flat File format
        
      Defaults to parsing $content as [XML], if no `$schema.input` is 
      specified.    

    * `$schema.output` is an optional input which determines whether to 
      serialize the resulting list of IData documents returned by `$service` 
      when all documents in the list are alike as [XML], [JSON], Flat File, 
      and can have the following values:
      * For [XML] content, specify the fully-qualified name of the document 
        reference that defines the [XML] format
      * For [JSON] content specify the MIME media type "application/json"
      * For Flat File content specify the fully-qualified name of the flat 
        file schema that defines the Flat File format

      returned by `$service` to contain unlike documents (documents whose 
      formats are different), and in this case `$service` is required to return 
      a string list `$schemas`, where each item in `$schemas` has a value 
      appropriate (document reference for [XML], flat file schema for Flat 
      Files, or the value "application/json" for [JSON]) for serializing the 
      corresponding indexed item in the returned document list.

      Defaults to serializing the returned documents as [XML], if no 
      `$schema.output` is specified, and no `$schemas` list is returned by 
      `$service`.

      of the call to `$service` for the parsed `$content` IData document. Defaults 
      to $document.

    * `$service.output` is an optional variable name used to extract the output 
      IData document list from the output pipeline of the call to `$service`. 
      Defaults to `$documents`.

    * `$content` is a string, byte array or input stream containing [XML], 
      [JSON], or Flat File content to be translated to another format.

    * `$service` is the fully-qualified name of the translation service, which 
      accepts a single IData document and returns a single IData document, 
      called to translate the parsed `$content`.

    * `$encoding.input` is an optional character set used to decode the text 
      data if `$content` is provided as a byte array or input stream. Defaults 
      to the Java virtual machine [default charset].

      translated text data if the specified `$mode.output` is a byte array or 
      stream. Defaults to the Java virtual machine [default charset].

    * `$schema.input` is an optional input which determines whether to parse the 
      content as [XML], [JSON], Flat File, and can have the following values:
      * For [XML] content, specify the fully-qualified name of the document 
        reference that defines the [XML] format

      Defaults to parsing `$content` as [XML], if no `$schema.input` is 
      specified.    

    * `$schema.output` is an optional input which determines whether to

  merged, the latest wins.

  This service can be useful for combining a document constructed with
  default values with a document sourced externally, where the merged
  document will contain the key set union of both documents, and will
  include default values where no value was present in the externally
  sourced document.

  Returns a new IData document with all fully qualified keys (for example,
  'a/b/c' or 'x/y[0]/z[1]') deconstructed into their constituent parts, and
  any non-IData objects converted to an IData representation wherever possible.

  For example, if the IData document contains the following key value pairs
  (using [JSON] notation to represent the pipeline):

      {
        "a/b/c": "example 1",
        "a/b/d": "example 2",
        "e": "example 3",
        "f[0]": "example 4",
        "f[1]": "example 5"
      }

  This is normalized to the following:

      {
        "a": {
          "b": {
            "c": "example 1",
            "d": "example 2"
          }
        },
        "e": "example 3",
        "f": ["example 4", "example 5"]
      }

  Keys using path-style notation, for example `a/b/c`, are
  converted to nested IData documents with the final key
  in the path, `c` in this example, assigned the value of
  the original key.

  Keys using array- or list-style notation, for example `f[0]`,
  are converted to an array or list with the value of the
  original key assigned to the indexed item (the zeroth item in
  this example).

  file.

  * Inputs:
    * `$file` is the file name to be normalized to the canonical
      file: [URI], specified as either a relative or absolute
      file path or file: [URI].

  * Outputs:
    * `$file` is the canonical file: [URI] that represents the
      given file.

* #### tundra.file:process

  Provides a safe way of processing a file as a stream, which
  is useful for large files or memory constrained environments,
  by opening a file for reading, writing, or appending, calling
  the given service with the opened file stream object as an
  input, and finally closing the stream when done.

  As such, the invoked service does not need to open or close the file
  stream itself, it only needs to process the opened file stream.
  The stream is guaranteed to be closed automatically, regardless
  of whether an exception is encountered by the service.

  * Inputs:
    * `$file` is the name of the file to be processed, specified
      as either a relative or absolute file path or file: [URI].
    * `$mode` is an optional choice of 'read', 'write', or
      'append' which determines whether the file is opened for
      reading, writing, or appending. Defaults to 'read'.
    * `$service` is the fully-qualified name of the service which
      will be called to process the opened file.
    * `$pipeline` is an optional IData document for specifying
      arbitrary input parameters to the call to `$service`. If
      provided, the call to `$service` is scoped with this IData,
      and will not have access to the global pipeline.
    * `$service.input` is an optional input parameter name used
      when adding the opened file stream to the input pipeline
      of the call tor `$service`. Defaults to '$stream'.

  * Outputs:
    * `$pipeline` is an optional IData document representing the
      output pipeline of the call to `$service`. This will only
      be returned if an input `$pipeline` was provided. If no
      input `$pipeline` was provided, any outputs from the call
      to `$service` will be merged directly into the global
      pipeline.

* #### tundra.file:read

  Reads a file in full, returning the content as either an input
  stream, byte array, or string.

  using tundra.file:process instead for large files or in memory
  constrained environments.

  * Inputs:
    * `$file` is the name of the file to be read, specified as
      either a relative or absolute file path or file: [URI].
    * `$mode` is an optional choice of 'stream', 'bytes', or
      'string' which determines how the file contents are
      returned. Defaults to 'stream'.
    * `$encoding` is an optional character set to use when reading
      the file as a string. Defaults to the Java virtual machine
      [default charset].

  * Outputs:
    * `$content` is the file contents returned as either an input
      stream, byte array, or string depending on the `$mode`
      selected. Note that even when returned as an input stream,
      the entire file has been read into memory. This mode is
      provided as a convenience only, and since the file contents
      are returned as a [java.io.ByteArrayInputStream] object the
      stream does not need to be explicitly closed as no system
      resources (file handles) are held.

* #### tundra.file:readable

  Returns true if Integration Server can read the given file.

  * Inputs:
    * `$file` is the name of the file to test if Integration Server has
      read permissions, specified as either a relative or absolute
      file path or file: [URI].

  * Outputs:
    * `$readable?` is a boolean flag indicating if Integration Server
      has permission to read the given file. If the file does not
      exist, false is returned.

  file does not exist (no exception is thrown).

  * Inputs:
    * `$file` is the name of the file to be deleted, specified as either a

  new file if it doesn't already exist.

  * Inputs:
    * `$file` is the name of the file to be touched, specified as either a
      relative or absolute file path or file: [URI]. If the file does not
      exist, it will be created. If the file does exist, its modification
      time will be updated to current time.

* #### tundra.file:type

  Determines the [mime type] for the given file.

  Integration Server file extension to [mime type] mappings are defined
  in the file ./lib/mime.types. If the [mime type] cannot be found, it
  defaults to the [mime type] for arbitrary binary data:

      application/octet-stream

  * Inputs:
    * `$file` is the name of the file whose mime type is to be determined,
      specified as either a relative or absolute file path or file: [URI].
      The file is not required to exist, since the mime type is determined
      purely from the file name itself.

  stream, to the given file.

  If no file is specified, a new temporary file is created automatically.

  * Inputs:
    * `$file` is the optional name of the file to which the given content
      is to be written or appended, specified as either a relative or
      absolute file path or file: [URI]. If not specified, a new temporary
      file will be created automatically.
    * `$mode` is an optional choice of 'write' or 'append', which determines
      whether the file will be overwritten or appended to respectively.
      Defaults to 'append', since this is the safer option.
    * `$content` is a string, byte array, or input stream containing data
      to be written or appended to the given file.
    * `$encoding` is an optional character set to use when $content has
      been provided as a string. Defaults to the Java virtual machine
      [default charset].

  * Outputs:
    * `$file` is the name of the file that was written or appended to. If
      no input file name was specified, this is the name of the temporary
      file that was created automatically.

      implements the `tundra.schema.http.response:handler` specification, and
      can be specified when the standard `tundra.http.response:handle` service
      does not suffice. The standard handler does the following:
      * checks the [HTTP response code] is < 400, and throws an exception
        when it is not
      * normalizes the response header keys to lower case
      * converts the response body stream to bytes

  * Outputs:
    * `$response` is an IData document containing the [HTTP] server response for
      the given request.

* #### tundra.http.response:handle

  Standard [HTTP] response handler: checks that the [HTTP response code] is < 400,
  normalizes the response header keys to lower case, and converts the response body
  stream to bytes. If the [HTTP response code] is >= 400, an exception will be
  thrown.

  * Inputs:
    * `$response` is the [HTTP] response to be processed by this service.

  * Outputs:
    * `$response` is the processed [HTTP] response, where the [HTTP response code] is
      guaranteed to be < 400, the response header keys are normalized to lower case,
      and the response body is returned as a byte[] array.

### ID

* #### tundra.id:generate

  Generates an immutable universally unique identifier ([UUID]). A [UUID]
  represents a 128-bit value.

  There exist different variants of these global identifiers. The methods
  of this class are for manipulating the Leach-Salz variant, although the
  constructors allow the creation of any variant of [UUID] (described below).

  The layout of a variant 2 (Leach-Salz) [UUID] is as follows: The most
  significant long consists of the following unsigned fields:

      0xFFFFFFFF00000000 time_low
      0x00000000FFFF0000 time_mid
      0x000000000000F000 version
      0x0000000000000FFF time_hi

  The least significant long consists of the following unsigned fields:

      0xC000000000000000 variant
      0x3FFF000000000000 clock_seq
      0x0000FFFFFFFFFFFF node

  The variant field contains a value which identifies the layout of the
  [UUID]. The bit layout described above is valid only for a [UUID] with a
  variant value of 2, which indicates the Leach-Salz variant.

  The version field holds a value that describes the type of this [UUID].
  There are four different basic types of UUIDs: time-based, DCE
  security, name-based, and randomly generated UUIDs. These types
  have a version value of 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively.

  For more information including algorithms used to create UUIDs,
  see the Internet-Draft UUIDs and GUIDs or the standards body
  definition at ISO/IEC 11578:1996.

        as an input). If invocation was synchronous and unscoped, the
        outputs of the invocation are merged directly with the pipeline
        itself. If the invocation was asynchronous, then no outputs
        are returned.
      * `thread` is returned only when the invocation `$mode` is asynchronous,
        and is the thread object which can later be waited on to finish

        "a/b/c": "example 1",
        "a/b/d": "example 2",
        "e": "example 3",

        "f": ["example 4", "example 5"]
      }

  Keys using path-style notation, for example "a/b/c", are
  converted to nested IData documents with the final key
  in the path, "c" in this example, assigned the value of
  the original key.

  Keys using array- or list-style notation, for example "f[0]",
  are converted to an array or list with the value of the
  original key assigned to the indexed item (the zeroth item in
  this example).

        execute as per the schedule, even if the previous schedule is
        still executing, which can result in multiple concurrent
        executions of the service.

        When false, the schedule will never be executed concurrently.
        For a repeat schedule, the next scheduled time is calculated
        from the end of execution of the previous schedule. For a complex

      Refer to the `tundra.condition:evaluate` service documentation for the
      format of conditional statements.

* #### tundra.schedule:resume

  Resumes (or unpauses) either the scheduled task identified by the given `$id`,

  Suspended tasks do not execute for the period they are suspended. Previously
  suspended tasks that are resumed will begin executing again according to
  their schedule.

  Attempting to resume tasks which are not suspended has no effect on the task,
  and results in no exception being thrown.

  The `$id` and `$filter` inputs are mutually exclusive: only one should be
  specified.

  * Inputs:
    * `$id` is an optional string identifier which identifies the schedule
      task to be resumed.

    * `$filter` is an optional `tundra.condition:evaluate` conditional statement.
      All scheduled tasks which satisfy the given filter condition will be

      which includes the task being evaluated as an IData document named
      `$schedule` with the same structure as returned by `tundra.schedule:get`.

      Examples of some filter strings are as follows:

      1. Resume all complex scheduled tasks:

         `%$schedule/type% == "complex"`

      2. Resume all scheduled tasks that execute `pub.string:concat`:

         `%$schedule/service% == "pub.string:concat"`

      3. Resume only the scheduled tasks that are suspended for a service
         whose name is stored in the pipeline variable `svc`:

         `%$schedule/status% == "suspended" and %$schedule/service% == %svc%`

      Refer to the `tundra.condition:evaluate` service documentation for the
      format of conditional statements.

* #### tundra.schedule:suspend

  Suspends (or pauses) either the scheduled task identified by the given `$id`,
  or every scheduled task that satisfies the given `$filter` condition.

  Suspended tasks do not execute for the period they are suspended. To start
  executing a suspended task according to its schedule, it should be resumed
  using `tundra.schedule:resume`.

  Attempting to suspend tasks that are already suspended has no effect on the
  task, and results in no exception being thrown.

  The `$id` and `$filter` inputs are mutually exclusive: only one should be
  specified.

  * Inputs:
    * `$id` is an optional string identifier which identifies the schedule
      task to be suspend.

    * `$filter` is an optional `tundra.condition:evaluate` conditional statement.
      All scheduled tasks which satisfy the given filter condition will be
      suspended. The conditional statement is evaluated against the pipeline,
      which includes the task being evaluated as an IData document named
      `$schedule` with the same structure as returned by `tundra.schedule:get`.

      Examples of some filter strings are as follows:

      1. Suspend all complex scheduled tasks:

         `%$schedule/type% == "complex"`

      2. Suspend all scheduled tasks that execute `pub.string:concat`:

         `%$schedule/service% == "pub.string:concat"`

      3. Suspend only the scheduled tasks that are not already suspended
         for a service whose name is stored in the pipeline variable `svc`:

         `%$schedule/status% != "suspended" and %$schedule/service% == %svc%`

    * `$duration.average` is the calculated mean or average duration of
      execution of the given service with the given input pipeline formatted
      as an [ISO8601] XML duration string.

    * `$duration.stdev` is the calculated standard deviation duration of
      execution of the given service with the given input pipeline formatted
      as an [ISO8601] XML duration string.

    * `$message` is a diagnostic message describing the execution statistics of
      the benchmarked service, which can be used for logging the results of
      the benchmark.

* #### tundra.service:callstack

  Returns the current call stack.

  * Outputs:
    * `$callstack` is a list of fully-qualified service names
      in invocation order with the top-level service as the
      first item.
    * `$callers` is a string representation of the call stack,
      which is useful for diagnostics/logging.
    * `$caller` is the fully-qualified service name of the
      immediate caller of the service which invoked
      tundra.service:callstack, which is useful for obtaining
      the name of the service which called the currently
      executing service.

* #### tundra.service:ensure

  Provides a try/catch/finally pattern for flow services.

  * Inputs
    * `$service` is the fully-qualified name of a service invoked
      in the [try block].
    * `$catch` is an optional fully-qualified name of a service
      invoked in the [catch block]. This service should
      implement the `Tundra/tundra.schema.exception:handler`
      specification. If no `$catch` service is specified, the
      exception will be rethrown.
    * `$finally` is an optional fully-qualified name of a service
      invoked in the [finally block] (always invoked regardless
      of whether an exception is thrown by `$service` or not).
    * `$pipeline` is an optional IData document which, if specified,
      contains the input arguments for the invocations of `$service`,
      `$catch`, and `$finally`; in other words, the calls to these
      services are scoped to this IData document. If not specified,
      the invocations are not scoped, and hence these services
      operate directly against the pipeline itself.

  * Outputs:
    * `$pipeline` is the output pipeline of the invocations of
      `$service`, `$catch`, and `$finally`. This is only returned if
      `$pipeline` was specified as an input. Otherwise, the outputs
      of these invocations are merged directly with the pipeline
      itself.

* #### tundra.service:initiator

  Returns true if the calling service is the initiating top-level
  service for this thread.

  * Outputs:
    * `$initiator?` is a boolean indicating if the calling service
      is the top-level service that initiated this thread.

* #### tundra.service:invoke

  Invokes a service either synchronously or asynchronously, and
  either scoped or unscoped.

  * Inputs
    * `$service` is the fully-qualified name of the service to be
      invoked.
    * `$pipeline` is an optional IData document which, if specified,
      contains the input arguments for the invocation of `$service`;
      in other words, the invocation is scoped to this IData document.
      If not specified, the invocation is unscoped, and hence the
      service will operate directly against the pipeline itself.
    * `$mode` is an optional choice of execution mode: either synchronous
      or asynchronous. When synchronous, the invocation of
      `Tundra/tundra.service:invoke` blocks until the invocation of
      `$service` completes. When asynchronous, `Tundra/tundra.service:invoke`
      returns immediately and the invocation of `$service` occurs on another
      thread.

  * Outputs:
    * `$pipeline` is the output pipeline of the invocation of
      `$service`. This is only returned if the `$mode` is synchronous,
      and the invocation was scoped (`$pipeline` was specified as an
      input). If the invocation was synchronous and unscoped, the
      outputs of the invocation are merged directly with the pipeline
      itself. If the invocation was asynchronous, then no outputs
      are returned.
    * `$thread` is returned only when the invocation `$mode` is asynchronous,
      and is the thread object which can later be waited on to finish
      using `Tundra/tundra.service:join`.

* #### tundra.service:join

  Waits for the given service thread to finish before returning the
  service output pipeline.

  * Inputs
    * `$thread` is a service thread object returned by
      `Tundra/tundra.service:invoke` when a service is invoked
      asynchronously.

  * Outputs:
    * `$pipeline` is the output pipeline returned by the service
      thread.

* #### tundra.service:nothing

  This service deliberately does nothing.

* #### tundra.service:respond

  Forces the specified response status and body to be returned by webMethods
  Integration Server to the calling process (such as an HTTP or FTP client).
  This service only works correctly when invoked by the top-level initiating
  service of the current thread, an unfortunate limitation of the platform.

  Unlike WmPublic/pub.flow:setResponseCode, which throws an exception when
  invoked for transports other than HTTP, this service succeeds regardless
  of the invoking transport.

  * Inputs:
    * `$code` is the [HTTP status code] for the returned response. For
      example, a 200 status code indicates the request was successful.
      For transports other than HTTP, a status code >= 400 will result
      in an exception being thrown. This is the appropriate response,
      as it will result in the correct action for those transports
      occurring (a SOAP fault for a SOAP invocation, a file transfer
      failure for an FTP invocation, etc).
    * `$message` is an optional message to be associated with the given
      status code. If not specified, the standard status message for
      the code will be used. This is only applicable to HTTP transports.
    * `$headers` is an optional IData document containing HTTP header
      keys and values to be added to the response. This is only applicable
      to HTTP transports.
    * `$content` is an optional string, byte array, or input stream containing
      the response body to be returned. If not specified, defaults to an
      empty string.
    * `$content.type` is the mime type of the given response body content. If
      not specified, defaults to application/octet-stream (the mime type for
      arbitrary binary data).
    * `$encoding` is an optional character set used to encode $content when
      specified as a string. Defaults to the Java virtual machine
      [default charset].

* #### tundra.service:self

  Returns the name of the current service, or null if invoked
  directly.

  * Outputs:
    * `$self` is the fully-qualified name of the current service
      (the service which called this service), or null if invoked
      directly.

* #### tundra.service:sleep

  Sends the currently executing thread to sleep (temporarily
  cease execution) for the specified duration, subject to the
  precision and accuracy of system timers and schedulers.

  * Inputs:
    * `$duration` is an [ISO8601]/XML duration for which the
      current thread should sleep.

* #### tundra.service:validate

  Returns true if the given service name exists and is actually
  a service.

  * Inputs:
    * `$service` is the name to be validated.
    * `$raise?` is a boolean flag indicating if an exception should
      be thrown if the given service is not valid. Defaults to
      false.

  * Outputs:
    * `$valid?` is a boolean flag indicating if the given service
      exists and is actually a service on this Integration Server.

* #### tundra.session:remove

  Removes the given key value pair from current session state.

  * Inputs:
    * `$key` is the optional key name to use to identify the key
      value pair to be removed from session state. If not specified,
      this service does nothing, otherwise the key value pair is
      removed from session state.

  * Outputs:
    * `$value` was the value associated with the removed `$key`.

### Stream

      identified by $key within it has been converted to a list. If
      no input `$scope` was specified, the value identified by `$key` in the
      pipeline is instead converted to a list. If `$key` does not identify
      any value, this service does nothing.

### URI

Services for parsing and emitting Uniform Resource Identifier ([URI]) strings.

* #### tundra.uri:decode

  Decodes a URI-encoded (application/x-www-form-urlencoded) string, according
  to [RFC 2396].

  The following rules are applied in the conversion:
  - The alphanumeric characters "a" through "z", "A" through "Z" and "0"
    through "9" remain the same.
  - The special characters ".", "-", "*", and "_" remain the same.
  - The plus sign "+" is converted into a space character " " .
  - A sequence of the form "%xy" will be treated as representing a byte
    where xy is the two-digit hexadecimal representation of the 8 bits. Then,
    all substrings that contain one or more of these byte sequences
    consecutively will be replaced by the character(s) whose encoding would
    result in those consecutive bytes. The encoding scheme used to decode
    these characters may be specified, or if unspecified, the default
    encoding of the platform will be used.

  Implemented with the [java.net.URLDecoder] class.

  * Inputs:
    * `$string` is a string containing URI-encoded data to be decoded.
    * `$encoding` is the character set used to determine what characters are
      represented by any consecutive sequences of the form "%xy". Defaults
      to the Java virtual machine [default charset].

  * Outputs:
    * `$string` is the decoded input string.

* #### tundra.uri:emit

  Emits a Uniform Resource Identifier ([URI]) string, according to [RFC 2396],
  given its constituent parts.

  URIs can be categorized as either hierarchical, where the scheme and body
  parts are separated by the character sequence '://', or opaque, where the
  scheme and body parts are separated by a ':' character.

  Examples of hierarchical URIs:
  - http://example.com/
  - ftp://example.com/path/file.txt

  Examples of opaque URIs:
  - mailto:john.doe@example.com
  - news:comp.lang.java
  - urn:isbn:096139210x

  Opaque URIs are constructed according to the following syntax:

      (scheme:)body(?query)(#fragment)

  Where brackets (...) delineate optional components and the characters
  ':', '?', and '#' stand for themselves.

  Hierarchical URIs are constructed according to the following syntax:

      (scheme:)(//authority)(path)(?query)(#fragment)

  Where the characters ':', '/', '?', and '#' stand for themselves. The authority
  component, if specified, can be either server-based or registry-based. If
  server-based, it is constructed according to the syntax:

      (user:password@)host(:port)

  Implemented with the [java.net.URI] class.

  * Inputs:
    * `$uri` is an IData document containing the constituent parts to construct
      a new URI string with.

  * Outputs:
    * `$string` is the resulting URI input string.

* #### tundra.uri:encode

  URI encodes (application/x-www-form-urlencoded) a string, according
  to [RFC 2396].

  The following rules are applied in the conversion:
  - The alphanumeric characters "a" through "z", "A" through "Z" and "0"
    through "9" remain the same.
  - The special characters ".", "-", "*", and "_" remain the same.
  - The plus sign "+" is converted into a space character " " .
  - A sequence of the form "%xy" will be treated as representing a byte
    where xy is the two-digit hexadecimal representation of the 8 bits. Then,
    all substrings that contain one or more of these byte sequences
    consecutively will be replaced by the character(s) whose encoding would
    result in those consecutive bytes. The encoding scheme used to decode
    these characters may be specified, or if unspecified, the default
    encoding of the platform will be used.

  Implemented with the [java.net.URLEncoder] class.

  * Inputs:
    * `$string` is a string containing data to be URI-encoded.
    * `$encoding` is the character set used to obtain the bytes for unsafe
      characters.. Defaults to the Java virtual machine [default charset].

  * Outputs:
    * `$string` is the URI-encoded input string.

* #### tundra.uri:parse

  Parses a Uniform Resource Identifier ([URI]) string, according to [RFC 2396],
  to its constituent parts.

  URIs can be categorized as either hierarchical, where the scheme and body
  parts are separated by the character sequence '://', or opaque, where the
  scheme and body parts are separated by a ':' character.

  Examples of hierarchical URIs:
  - http://example.com/
  - ftp://example.com/path/file.txt

  Examples of opaque URIs:
  - mailto:john.doe@example.com
  - news:comp.lang.java
  - urn:isbn:096139210x

  Opaque URIs are constructed according to the following syntax:

      (scheme:)body(?query)(#fragment)

  Where brackets (...) delineate optional components and the characters
  ':', '?', and '#' stand for themselves.

  Hierarchical URIs are constructed according to the following syntax:

      (scheme:)(//authority)(path)(?query)(#fragment)

  Where the characters ':', '/', '?', and '#' stand for themselves. The authority
  component, if specified, can be either server-based or registry-based. If
  server-based, it is constructed according to the syntax:

      (user:password@)host(:port)

  Where the characters '@' and ':' stand for themselves.

  Opaque URI bodies are not subject to further parsing, however, to accomodate
  the mailto: URI's use of a query string for additional data (such as cc, bcc,
  subject, and body), this service checks if the body contains a query string
  and, if so, parses the query string also.

  Implemented with the [java.net.URI] class.

  * Inputs:
    * `$string` is the a URI string to be parsed.

  * Outputs:
    * `$uri` is an IData document containing the constituent parts of the parsed
      URI string.

### User

* #### tundra.user:current

  Returns the current Integration Server user used to invoke this service.

  * Outputs:
    * $user is the currently logged on user name that invoked this service.

### XML

* #### tundra.xml:validate

  Validates the given content as [XML], and optionally against an [XML]
  schema ([XSD]). Uses the Simple API for XML ([SAX]) algorithm for
  parsing which, as it is event-based, is not memory-constrained and
  can handle arbitrarily large documents when parsing from an input stream.

  * Inputs:
    * `$content` is a string, byte array, or input stream containing
      (potentially) [XML] data.
    * `$content.encoding` is the character set used by `$content` if provided as
      a byte array or input stream. Defaults to the Java virtual machine
      [default charset].
    * `$schema` is a string, byte array, or input stream containing [XSD] data.
    * `$schema.encoding` is the character set used by `$schema` if provided as
      a byte array or input stream. Defaults to the Java virtual machine
      [default charset].
    * `$raise?` is an optional boolean flag, if true and `$content` is malformed
      or invalid an exception will be thrown. If false, no exception will
      be thrown. Defaults to false.

  * Outputs:
    * `$valid?` is true if the given `$content` is well-formed [XML] and, if a
      `$schema` was specified, valid when compared to the given `$schema`.
    * `$errors` is an optional list of the errors detected by the parser in
      the given `$content`, provided when `$valid?` is false.

### XPath

* #### tundra.xpath:exists

  Returns true if the given XPath expression `$expression` exists the given
  XML `$content`.

  * Inputs:
    * `$content` is a string, byte array, or input stream containing XML data.
    * `$encoding` is the character set used by `$content` if provided as a byte
      array or input stream. Defaults to the Java virtual machine [default
      charset].
    * `$expression` is the [XPath expression] to be tested against `$content`.

  * Outputs:
    * `$exists?` is true if the XPath expression was found to exist in the
      given `$content`.

### ZIP

* #### tundra.zip:compress

  Compresses the given contents using the [zip] file compression format.

  * Inputs:
    * `$contents` is an IData document list containing the data to be
      compressed.
      * `name` is the file path and name given to this item in the
        resulting zip archive.
      * `content` is the data to be compressed, specified as either a
        string, byte array, or input stream.
      * `encoding` is an optional character set used when `content` is
        specified as a string. Defaults to the Java virtual machine
        [default charset].
    * `$mode` is an optional choice of 'stream', 'bytes', or
      'string', which determines the type of object returned by
      this service. If the 'string' mode is chosen, the resulting
      zipped data is base64-encoded. Defaults to 'stream'.

  * Outputs:
    * `$contents.zip` is the resulting compressed data in [zip] format.

* #### tundra.zip:decompress

  Decompresses the given content using the [zip] file compression format.

  * Inputs:
    * `$contents.zip` is the [zip] compressed data to be decompressed,
      specified as a base64-encoded string, byte array, or input stream.
    * `$encoding` is an optional character set used to decode the
      decompressed data when the chosen `$mode` is 'string'. Defaults to
      the Java virtual machine [default charset].
    * `$mode` is an optional choice of 'stream', 'bytes', or 'string',
      which determines the type of content returned by this service.
      Defaults to 'stream'.

  * Outputs:
    * `$contents` is an IData document list containing the resulting
      decompressed data.
      * `name` is the file path and name assigned to this item in the
        zip archive.
      * `content` is the decompressed data associated with this item.
